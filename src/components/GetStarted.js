    <p class="lead">Mineral fasting is a lifestyle that promotes and is focused on fasting.  Other wise known as a fasting focused lifestyle. Mineral fasting focuses on the benefits received from fasting, and what happens between meals versus what happens when we are eating.
    </p>
<br/>
    <p class="lead">We live in excess.  Food is available 24/7.  The conveniences that we have at our fingertips has cheapened the quality of the food we eat, and the excess amount that’s available to us.  Mineral fasting helps to reset and alleviate cravings and addictions to foods that are harmful to our health.  The Mineral Fasting program will help you better understand your body and it’s ability to heal itself at a cellar level.

    <p class="lead">Our bodies either burn carbohydrates for fuel or fat.  Sugars, or carbs, are stored as glycogen in the liver.  If the body does not utilize this form of energy that is there for immediate use, it will be stored as far.  The catch is, there is no limit on how much fat the body can store. And, you can’t utilize this energy source until the liver has been depleted of it’s stores of sugars first. This is where the bodies innate fat burning for fuel mechanism comes in to play.
</p>
<br/>
    <p class="lead">When we are eating frequently through out the day, our insulin goes up, our liver is storing the excess, which is then converted to fat, and we end up on this hamster wheel of weight gain that feeds in to an endless cycle of yoyoing.  Our bodies were not meant to eat all the time.  Nor were they meant to eat all you can eat.  Our bodies were meant to fast.  We fast when we sleep, we fast in between meals.  And fasting for long periods of time and help alleviate stress from the digestive tract, so it can take a break and heal.
</p>
<br/>

    <h3 class="display-5">What to Expect:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Fasting can become enjoyable, but may not be when you are first starting out.  Aside of medications, and food addictions, caffein withdraws are some of the strongest and most noticeable.  You might experience headaches, fatigue, irritation, and other uncomfortable emotions. These will pass, just stay with the process.
        </li>
        <li>
        You will be met with difference theories and opinions by family members and friends.  They may not understand the process and may challenge your decisions that may lead to arguments about eating disorders, and starvations.  Although their intentions may be supported by concern, they may be misguided.  Encourage them to do some research and they will find that a fasting focused lifestyle is one that has been around for centuries and has extensive research behind it.    
        </li>
        <li>
        Expect to have challenges.  Your body is not used to this process, and needs to become adapted to burning fat.  To get to this place, you may experience hunger pains, and feelings of defeat.  Push through, this will pass.  Once you become fat adapted, you won’t have hunger pains, or lack of energy.  In fact, you may struggle trying to eat enough.  Those who have gotten to that point know what it’s like, and soon, you’ll crave being fat adapted over food.
        </li>
        <li>
        You may fall off your program at times, and that’s ok.  Get back on and begin fasting again.  The 48 hour fast is a kick start to help rid your body of any sugar or caffein addictions.  If you fall off, begin again with the 48 hour fast, and move forward.
